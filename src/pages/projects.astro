          John Clow served as the lead developer of PyRTL during his junior and senior years at UCSB,
          where he worked in the Architecture Lab researching and developing improved ways for describing flow graphs for hardware.

          PyRTL is a Python-based hardware description language that provides classes for register-transfer level design, simulation, tracing, and testing suitable for teaching and research, with goals emphasizing simplicity, usability, clarity, and extensibility pyrtl.
