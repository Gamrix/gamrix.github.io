      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight md:text-5xl">
        Hi, I'm Gamrix &mdash; a San Francisco-based software enginner and maker.
      </h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
        I build AI systems, craft interactive installations, and help communities create inclusive experiences where technology, art, and people collide.

          <p class="text-muted-foreground">
            My career has taken me through major tech companies and early-stage projects where applied machine learning makes a tangible difference. I love translating theory into resilient systems and tuning models that stay accountable to the people who depend on them.
          </p>

            <li>Designing and training AI models with an eye toward prompt engineering, evaluation, and optimization.</li>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Creative technology</h2>
          <p class="text-muted-foreground">
            I'm a hands-on maker who pairs software with fabrication.
             Whether it's laser cutting, digital fabrication, or smart lighting,
              I enjoy prototyping ideas that invite people to play and explore.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted-foreground">
            You'll often find me at local maker spaces in San Francisco,
            iterating on pieces that blend code-generated patterns with tactile materials.

        <section class="space-y-4">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Community &amp; culture</h2>
          <p class="text-muted-foreground">
            Participatory communities are where I feel most at home. With camps like
            Future Turtles and Comfort &amp; Joy at Burning Man, I help design everything
             from technical infrastructure to consent-forward experiences.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted-foreground">
            Collaboration, care, and inclusive spaces are the throughline in every
             project&mdash;it's how we sustain the magic long after the dust settles.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Adventure mindset</h2>
          <p class="text-muted-foreground">
            Travel fuels my curiosity. I've chased powder from Aspen to the New Zealand, wandered
             across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and brought those perspectives back into the
              teams and communities I support.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted-foreground">
            The world is wide, and every trip reminds me to design technology that respects the contexts it touches.
